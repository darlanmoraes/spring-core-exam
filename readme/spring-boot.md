## Spring Boot

- What is Spring Boot?
- What are the advantages of using Spring Boot?
- Why is it "opinionated"?
- How does it work? How does it know what to configure?
- What things affect what Spring Boot sets up?
- How are properties defined? Where?
- Would you recognize common Spring Boot annotations and configuration properties if you saw them in the exam?
- What is the difference between an embedded container and a WAR?
- What embedded containers does Spring Boot support?
- What does @EnableAutoConfiguration do? What about @SpringBootApplication?
- What is a Spring Boot starter POM? Why is it useful?
- Spring Boot supports both Java properties and YML files. Would you recognize and understand them if you saw them?
- Can you control logging with Spring Boot? How?
- Note that the second Spring Boot section (Going Further) is not required for this exam. Remember: Unless a question explicitly references Spring Boot (like those in this section) you can assume Spring Boot is not involved in any question.
